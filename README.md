# Meteor-hello-world-v2-game

This is little game wich I made for my presentation on **Meteor** (https://www.meteor.com/).

It's Meteor default app on "steroid" (not really), transformed to a game.

Clone repo and in it's folder start meteor server.

How to play?
- register as new user
- click the button
- first player with 50 clicks wins

2do:
- When it's finished you can't start it again unless you do '*`meteor reset`*' (on server, doh)
